                        <p>Tom Brady, born on August 3, 1977, in San Mateo, California, is an iconic figure in the world of American football, known for his extraordinary career as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). His journey from a relatively unheralded college player to one of the most successful and celebrated athletes in the history of professional sports is a testament to his skill, work ethic, and competitive spirit.</p>
                        <p>Brady played college football for the University of Michigan from 1995 to 1999. Despite a competitive environment and initially serving as a backup, he eventually became the starting quarterback.
                            During his time at Michigan, he had notable performances, particularly in his final year, leading the team to an Orange Bowl victory.
                            </p>
                        <p>Brady was selected by the New England Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft, a choice that would become one of the biggest draft steals in NFL history.
                            He became the Patriots' starting quarterback in his second season after an injury to Drew Bledsoe and led the team to its first Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl XXXVI.
                            Brady spent 20 seasons with the Patriots, forming one of the most successful partnerships in sports history with head coach Bill Belichick. Together, they reached nine Super Bowls, winning six.
                            In 2020, Brady signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and, in his first season with the team, led them to victory in Super Bowl LV, marking his seventh Super Bowl win and further cementing his legacy.
